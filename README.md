# IT262-Group3-bpm
Project starts with altered P1 code: For this project, your team will select the simplest version of the P1 (temperature conversion) project amongst the team members.  Remove a large portion of the code and take turns adding small portions of the code back into the file until it is working properly again.  Start a repo and add all members as collaborators.  If your repo is private, give me access by making me a collaborator.  My GitHub username is kyrrahnork. Once this is done members will take turns making small additions or corrections to the code on branches and making pull requests to be processed by the next team member.

Order of operations for each team member:

Create a named branch, make a change/addition to the code
Create a pull request to indicate you'd like a second pair of eyes to view/edit your addition
Contact the next person in your group to view your work, process the pull request and merge your branch
That person deletes the old branch, starts a new branch and begins the process again, with the next person on your team.
